I think this module reads the data generated by openhd-system and setups:
1) Wifi cards to monitor mode if supported
2) Hotspot if a hotspot wifi card is there (for example the rpi included wifi card, which doesnt do monitor mode anyways)
3) Ethernet for a lan connection to the air/ground pi.

Since it needs the hw capabilities from openhd-system it MUST RUN AFTER openhd-system.

Hmm, I think this service also starts the wfb_tx / wfb_rx instances.

I think it is possible to have this service constrained by "run once at startup, then never again" paradigm.

## For now, this module must setup the following wifibroadcast links, since they are needed by openhd-telemetry
## and openhd-video:

1) Bidirectional link made up of 2 wifibroadcast instances for telemetry up / down, both on air and ground
2) 2 Unidirectional links for video down from air pi to ground pi (primary and secondary video stream)
 -> NOTE: Video only goes from air pi to ground pi, so we need 2 tx instances on air pi and
    2 rx instances on ground pi 

look at the code to find out the ports usw, they should come from openhd-constants
