/**
 * TODO migrate
 * OHDLink refers to the "link that transmits data from/to the air unit to the ground unit".
 * It hides away the underlying implementation (e.g. wifibroadcast aka wifi cards in monitor mode or lte or ... )
 * However, r.n the only existing implementation is wifibroadcast.
 * What a openhd link MUST support to integrate with openhd is well defined:
 * 1) Send telemetry data from air to ground and vice versa
 *  => 1 bidirectional (aka air to ground and ground to air) but (recommended) lossy (since mavlink deals with packet loss / retransmissions /) link
 * 2) Send video data from air to ground, recommended 2 instances (primary and secondary video), at least 1 required
 *  => 2x unidirectional (recommended lossy, but FEC protected) links for primary and secondary video from air to ground
 *
 *  In general, there should be exactly one instance of ohd_link on the air unit and one on the ground unit.
