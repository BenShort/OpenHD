# July 23: Everything here is obsolete

# Brief:
Scripts, probably temporarily.
Eventually this directory should become "empty" and be removed. c++ provides much more type safety and
functionalities, even if in the end it is mostly commands started from c++-

# For packaging:
Here are all scripts that might be called by OpenHD code.
The whole content of this directory should be copied into:
/usr/local/share/openhd
independent of the platform.
