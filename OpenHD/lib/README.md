Any repositories / code that are non platform dependent and also have their own repositories under the
OpenHD namespace should be added here as git submodules.
Note: Drivers or similar should not end up here, as well as libraries that can simly be installed by apt-get
(well maintained libraries)

git submodule add -b XTelemetryTest git@github.com:Consti10/wifibroadcast.git
